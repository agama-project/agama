# Translations

This directory contains translation files for the web frontend part of the Agama
installer. See more details in the main [i18n](../../doc/i18n.md) documentation.

## Contribution

:warning: *WARNING: Do not manually change any files here! The files are
automatically overwritten by the files from the
[agama-weblate](https://github.com/agama-project/agama-weblate/tree/master/web) Git
repository! Your changes would be lost on the next synchronization!* :warning:

For updating the translations use the [Agama Weblate
project](https://l10n.opensuse.org/projects/agama/agama-web/). The changes
in the Weblate are automatically saved to the agama-weblate repository
and later a pull request with the changes is automatically created for merging
the changes here.

Alternatively you can open a pull request against the
[agama-weblate](https://github.com/agama-project/agama-weblate/web) GitHub
repository. But that requires manual approving and merging, prefer using the
Weblate tool, it merges automatically.
