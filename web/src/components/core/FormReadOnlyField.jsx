/**
 * Renders a read-only form value with a label that visually looks identically
 * that a a label of an editable form value, without using the `label` HTML tag.
 *
 * Basically, this "mimicking component" is needed for two reasons:
 *
 * - The HTML specification limits the use of labels to "labelable elements".
 *
 *   > Some elements, not all of them form-associated, are categorized as labelable
 *   > elements. These are elements that can be associated with a label element.
 *   >   => button, input (if the type attribute is not in the Hidden state), meter,
 *   >      output, progress, select, textarea, form-associated custom elements
 *   >
 *   > https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/forms.html#categories
 *
 * - Agama does not use disabled form controls for rendering a value that users
 *   have no chance to change by any means, but a raw text instead.
 *
 * Based on PatternFly Form styles to maintain consistency.
