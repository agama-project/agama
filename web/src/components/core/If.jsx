/**
 * Helper component for simplifying conditional interpolation in JSX blocks.
 * @component
 *
 * Borrowed from the old  Michael J. Ryanâ€™s comment at https://github.com/facebook/jsx/issues/65#issuecomment-255484351
 * See more options at https://blog.logrocket.com/react-conditional-rendering-9-methods/
 *
 * Please, use it only when "conditionally interpolating" content in a
 * "JSX block". For rendering a content or null it's better to go for an early
 * return.
 *
 * @example <caption>Using an early return instead</caption>
 *   ...
 *   if (loaded) return <Ready />
 *
 *   return (
 *     <Card>
 *       <Title>Loading data</Title>
 *       <Body>
 *         <LoadingProgress />
 *       </Body>
 *     </Card>
 *   );
 *   ...
 *
 * @example <caption>Using `<If>` in a JSX block</caption>
 *   ...
 *   return (
 *     <Card>
 *       <Title>Loading data</Title>
 *       <Body>
 *         <If condition={loading} then={<Spinner />} />
 *         <If condition={loadingStorage} then={<LoadingStorageData />} else={<StorageLoaded />} />
 *         <If condition={loadingNetwork} then={<LoadingNetwork />} else={<NetworkLoaded />} />
 *       </Body>
 *     </Card>
 *   );
 *   ...
 *
 * @param {object} props
 * @param {boolean} props.condition
 * @param {JSX.Element} [props.then=null] - the content to be rendered when the condition is true
 * @param {JSX.Element} [props.else=null] - the content to be rendered when the condition is false
