 *
 * NOTE: We use the Popup component for displaying a question, wrapping its actions inside a

 * React.Fragment (aka <>) here for wrapping the actions instead of directly using the Popup.Actions.

 * @param props.actionCallback - the function to call when the user clicks on the action
 * @param props.conditions={} - an object holding conditions, like when an action is disabled
