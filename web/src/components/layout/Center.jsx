/**
 * Wrapper component for centering vertically its children
 *
 * @note It could be replaced by the 'vertically-centered' CSS utility class once Firefox add support
 *   by default for the :has selector, which allows having something like
 *
 *   .parent:has(.vertically-centered) {
 *     display: grid;
 *     place-items: center;
 *     block-size: 100%;
 *   }
 *
 *   .vertically-centered { inline-size: 100%; }
 *
 *   We can use \@support CSS at rule and use a workaround when :has not available, but somehow
 *   prefer waiting until Firefox gets support.
 *
 *   To know more, read
 *     - https://www.w3.org/TR/selectors-4/#relational
 *     - https://ishadeed.com/article/css-has-parent-selector/
 *
 * @param {object} props
 * @param {React.ReactNode} props.children
