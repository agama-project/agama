   * The Questions component is mounted within the application layout
   * (src/components/Layout.tsx). However, certain branches in src/App.tsx force
   * to render the Loading component before the layout is mounted.
   *
   * This behavior requires a mechanism to enable the loading to listen
   * for and render backend questions before the frontend has all the
   * data necessary to fully mount the layout.
   *
   * This is why this prop exists. While this could be improved and ideally
   * the Loading component shouldnâ€™t need to wrap itself with the layout, be
   * cautious when tempted to remove this behavior without a solid alternative.
   * Doing so could silently reintroduced the regression fixed in
   * https://github.com/agama-project/agama/pull/1825
   *
   * FIXME: Find and implement a solid alternative
