# Official Agama Live ISO

Agama **is a multi-product installer**. It means that you can install different distributions using
a single medium. In close collaboration with the openSUSE project, the current image allows
installing [openSUSE Tumbleweed](https://www.opensuse.org/#Tumbleweed), [openSUSE Leap 16.0
Alpha](https://www.opensuse.org/#Leap) and [openSUSE Micro OS](https://get.opensuse.org/microos/).

## Download the Agama Live ISO

The first step is to download the ISO image that matches your architecture.

<Tabs className="unique-tabs">
  <TabItem value="x86_64" label="x86_64" default>
    <ISOLinks arch="x86_64" />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="aarch64" label="aarch64">
    <ISOLinks arch="aarch64" />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="ppc64le" label="ppc64le">
    <ISOLinks arch="ppc64le" />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="s390x" label="s390x">
    <ISOLinks arch="s390x" />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

You might want to check whether the ISO was correctly downloaded. If that's the case, you can
download the checksum file too and use the
[sha256sum](https://manpages.opensuse.org/Tumbleweed/coreutils-doc/sha256sum.1.en.html) command:

```shell
sha256sum -c agama-installer.x86_64-openSUSE.sha256
```

Obviously, use the checksum that correponds with downloaded ISO.

## Creating a bootable medium

Once you have the ISO, it is time to [create a bootable USB
stick](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Live_USB_stick) (recommended) or [burn a
worry, we have you covered:
DVD](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Download_help#Using_Linux). If you are not using Linux, do not

## Starting the installation

Starting the system using the bootable medium should take you to the product selection screen.
Please, bear in mind that it may take a few seconds.

The Agama Live ISO allows some customizations during boot (e.g., setting up the network, changing
the `root` password, etc.). Please, check the **boot options** (link) for further information.
