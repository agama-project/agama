# About

This section covers a wide range of Agama-related topics. To make it easy to find the information
you are looking for, the documentation is organized in two different parts, depending on your
perspective.

- [Users documentation](./user): it explains how to use Agama to install a system. It is oriented towards
  users that want to use an Agama Live ISO (e.g., the [openSUSE Agama ISO](../download)) to
  perform an installation.
- [Developer resources](./devel/): are you interested in Agama's development? Then do not forget
  to check out these resources.

:::warning Work in progress
The documentation is still a work in progress. Please, do not hesitate to give us feedback if you
find something is missing or unclear. Actually, you can even open a pull request if you want to.
