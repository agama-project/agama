# Development resources

This section contains a ton of technical information about Agama development. The [Agama's
architecture](./architecture.md) offers a nice overview about the project and it might be a good
starting point. If you want to set up your development environment, we may suggest to read [running
from sources](./running.md).

Feel free to review the rest of the sections in no particular order.
