# User documentation

Agama is a generic Linux installer, although at this point is only able to install SUSE and
openSUSE-based distributions. In close collaboration with the openSUSE community, we maintain the
[openSUSE Live ISO](/download), which uses Agama to install several openSUSE distributions.

The documentation in this section should be useful for any Live ISO that makes use of Agama, but the
openSUSE Live ISO is the reference.

:::tip
Making Agama extensible is a long-term goal, but we are not focused on that yet.
