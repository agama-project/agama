# Storage Section of the Agama Profile

This document describes Agama's approach to configure storage using a profile for unattended
installation.

## Agama and AutoYaST

AutoYaST profiles can be used with Agama offering a 100% backward compatibility.

The `legacyAutoyastStorage` section of the Agama profile is a 1:1 representation of the XML
specification of AutoYaST. No JSON validation will be performed for it.

~~~json
{
  "legacyAutoyastStorage": [
    {
      "use": "all",
      "partitions": []
    }
  ]
}
~~~

### Implementation Considerations for AutoYaST Specification

In principle, implementing the legacy AutoYaST module is as simple as converting the corresponding
section of the profile into a `Y2Storage::PartitioningSection` object and use
`Y2Storage::AutoInstProposal` to calculate the result.

But there are some special cases in which AutoYaST fallbacks to read some settings from the YaST
settings or to use some YaST mechanisms. Those cases should be taken into account during the
implementation.

For example, AutoYaST relies on the traditional YaST proposal settings when "auto" is used to
specify the size of a partition or to determine the default list of subvolumes when Btrfs is used.
See also the sections "Automatic Partitioning" and "Guided Partitioning" at the AutoYaST
documentation for situations in which AutoYaST uses the standard YaST `GuidedProposal` as fallback.

### Problems with the AutoYaST Schema

The AutoYaST schema is far from ideal and it presents some problems.

#### Everything Is a Drive or a Partition Section

This could seem a minor detail, but it has several implications:

* A `<type>` property is required to indicated the type of device (*RAID*, *LVM*, etc).
* Some properties could be meaningless for the selected type.
* Having a `<partitions>` section for describing logical volumes is weird.

~~~xml
<partitioning config:type="list">
  <drive>
    <type config:type="symbol">CT_LVM</type>
    <disklabel>gpt</disklabel> <!-- It does not make sense for a volume group -->
    <partitions config:type="list"> <!-- It really means logical volumes -->
      <partition>
        <partition_id>131</partition_id> <!-- It does not make sense for a logical volume -->
      </partition>
    </partitions>
  </drive>
</partitioning>
~~~

#### Directly Formatting Devices is Hammered

A `<partitions>` section is still needed for directly formatting a device, which shows the abuse of
the schema.

~~~xml
<partitioning config:type="list">
  <drive>
    <disklabel>none</disklabel>
    <partitions config:type="list">
      <partition>
        <filesystem config:type="symbol">btrfs</filesystem>
      </partition>
    </partitions>
  </drive>
</partitioning>
~~~

#### Selecting Devices is Difficult and Limited

The AutoYaST schema allows selecting specific devices by using the `<skip_list>` property. This
forces to use inverse logic when looking for a device. For example, if you want to select a disk
bigger than 1 GiB, then you have to skip the smaller disks:

~~~xml
<partitioning config:type="list">
  <drive>
    <skip_list config:type="list">
      <!-- skip devices that are smaller than 1GB -->
      <listentry>
        <skip_key>size_k</skip_key>
        <skip_value>1048576</skip_value>
        <skip_if_less_than config:type="boolean">true</skip_if_less_than>
      </listentry>
    </skip_list>
  </drive>
</partitioning>
~~~

The partitions to remove are selected by means of the `<use>` property, which is very limited. It
only allows removing everything, nothing, specific partition numbers or linux partitions.

~~~xml
<partitioning config:type="list">
  <drive>
    <device>/dev/sdc</device>
    <use>2</use> <!-- Removes the partition number 2 -->
    <partitions config:type="list">
      ...
    </partitions>
  </drive>
</partitioning>
~~~

The property `<partition_nr>` is used for reusing a partition. Again, this option is very limited,
allowing selecting a partition only by its number.

~~~xml
<partitioning config:type="list">
  <drive>
    <device>/dev/sdc</device>
    <partitions config:type="list">
      <partition>
        <partition_nr>1</partition_nr> <!-- Reuse the partition number 1 -->
      </partition>
    </partitions>
  </drive>
</partitioning>
~~~

Note that you could indicate the same partition number for deleting (`<use>`) and for reusing (`<partition_nr>`).

#### Devices Are Created in a Indirect Way

For creating new LVM volume groups, RAIDS, etc, it is necessary to indicate which devices to use as
logical volumes or as RAID members. In AutoYaST, the partitions have to indicate the device they are
going to be used by.

~~~xml
<partitioning config:type="list">
  <drive>
    <device>/dev/sda</device>
    <partitions config:type="list">
      <partition>
        <raid_name>/dev/md/0</raid_name> <!-- Indicate what device is going to use it -->
      </partition>
    </partitions>
  </drive>
  <drive>
    <device>/dev/sdb</device>
    <partitions config:type="list">
      <partition>
        <raid_name>/dev/md/0</raid_name>
      </partition>
    </partitions>
  </drive>
  <drive>
    <device>/dev/md/0</device>
  </drive>
</partitioning>
~~~

It would be more natural to indicate the used devices directly in the RAID or logical volume drive.

## The New Storage Schema

Agama offers its own storage schema which is more semantic, comprehensive and flexible than the
AutoYaST one.

The new schema allows:

* To clearly distinguish between different types of devices and their properties.
* To perform more advanced searches for disks, partitions, etc.
* To indicate deleting and resizing on demand.

The Agama schema is used by a new Agama specific proposal. This decouples the algorithm from the
AutoYaST one, making much easier to support new use cases and avoiding backward compatibility with
fringe AutoYaST scenarios. It also supports some features that are not available in the AutoYaST
proposal like deleting or resizing partitions on demand.

### Basic Structure of the Storage Section

A formal specification of the outer level of the `storage` section would look like this.

```
Storage
  drives <Drive[]>
  volumeGroups <VolumeGroup[]>
  mdRaids <MdRaid[]>
  btrfsRaids <BtrfsRaid[]>
  nfsMounts <NFS[]>
  boot [BootSettings]
  encryption [EncryptionSettings]
```

Thus, a `storage` section can contain several entries describing how to configure the corresponding
storage devices and a couple of extra entries to setup some general aspects that influence the final
layout.

Each volume group, RAID, bcache device or NFS share can represent a new logical device to be created
or an existing device from the system to be processed. Entries below `drives` represent devices
that can be used as regular disks. That includes removable and fixed disks, SD cards, DASD or zFCP
devices, iSCSI disks, multipath devices, etc. Those entries always correspond to devices that can be
found at the system, since Agama cannot create that kind of devices.

In fact, a single entry can represent several devices from the system. That is explained in depth at
the section "searching existing devices" of this document.

On the first versions of Agama, an alternative syntax will be accepted including only one `guided`
entry.

```
Storage
  guided <Guided>
```

That allows to rely on the YaST component known as `GuidedProposal`. That alternative will be
removed as soon as all the capabilities of that `GuidedProposal` could be expressed in terms of a
regular storage configuration like the one explained above.

### Entries for Describing the Devices

The formal specification of the previous section can be extended as we dive into the structure.

```

```

To illustrate how all that fits together, let's see the following example in which the first disk of
the system is partitioned and a volume group is created on top of that partition (after encrypting
it) to allocate two file systems.

```json
"storage": {
    "drives": [
        {
            "partitions": [
                {
                    "alias": "pv",
                    "id": "lvm",
                    "size": { "min": "12 GiB" },
                    "encryption": {
                        "luks2": { "password": "my secret passphrase" }
                    }
                }
              ]
        }
    ],
    "volumeGroups": [
        {
            "name": "system",
            "physicalVolumes": [ "pv" ],
            "logicalVolumes": [
                {
                    "size":   { "min": "10 GiB" },
                    "filesystem": { "path": "/", "type": "btrfs" }
                },
                {
                    "size":   "2 GiB",
                    "filesystem": { "path": "swap", "type": "swap" }
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

### Specifying the Size of a Device

When creating some kinds of devices or resizing existing ones (if possible) it may be necessary to
specify the desired size. As seen in the specification above, that can be done in several ways.

The most straightforward one is just using a string that can be parsed into a valid size.

The second option is to provide a minimum size and an optional maximum one. The resulting size will
be between those thresholds. If the maximum is omitted or set to `null`, the device will grow as
much as possible, taking into account the available spaces and all the other specified sizes.

The third option is to use the string "default". That means Agama will decide the size based on the
mount point and the settings of the product. From a more technical point of view, that translates
into the following:

 - If the mount path corresponds to a volume supporting `auto_size`, that feature will be used.
 - If it corresponds to a volume without `auto_size`, the min and max sizes of the volumes will be
   used.
 - If there is no volume for that mount path, the sizes of the default volume will be used.
 - If the product does not specify a default volume, the behavior is still not defined (there are
   several reasonable options).

It is also possible to specify "current" as a size value for partitions and logical volumes that
already exist in the system. The usage of "current" and how it affects resizing the corresponding
devices is explained at a separate section below.

#### Under Discussion

As explained, it should be possible to specify the sizes as "default", as a range or as a fixed
value. But in the last two cases, a parseable string like "40 GiB" may not be the only option to
represent a size. The following two possibilities are also under consideration.

 - `{ "gib": 40 }`
 - `{ "value": 40, "units": "gib" }`

### Partitions Needed for Booting

Using a `boot` entry makes it possible to configure whether (and where, using an alias) Agama
should calculate and create the extra partitions needed for booting. If the device is not
specified, Agama will take the location of the root file system as a reference.

### Searching Existing Devices

Many sections in the profile are used to describe how some devices must be created, modified or even
deleted. In the last two cases, it's important to match the description with one or more devices
from the system.

If a description matches several devices, the same operations will be applied to
all. That's useful in several situations like applying the same partitioning schema to several disks
or deleting all partitions of a disk that match a given criteria.

Matching is performed using a `search` subsection. The format is still under heavy discussion but
may look similar to this.

```
Search
  condition [<Condition>]
  sort [<Sort>]
  max [<number>]
  ifNotFound [<NotFoundAction='skip'>]

Condition <Rule|OperatorAnd|OperatorOr>

OperatorAnd
  and: <Condition[]>

OperatorOr
  or: <Condition[]>

Rule
  property <string>
  value <any>
  operator [<Operator='equal'>]

Operator <'equal'|'notEqual'|'less'|'greater'|'lessOrEqual'|'greaterOrEqual'>

Sort
  property <string>
  order <'asc'|'desc'>

NotFoundAction <'create'|'skip'|'error'>
```

By default, all devices in the scope fitting the conditions will be matched. The number of device
matches can be limited using `max`. The following example shows how several `search` sections could
be used to find the three biggest disks in the system, delete all linux partitions bigger than 1 GiB
within them and create new partitions of type RAID.

```json
"storage": {
    "drives": [
        {
            "search": {
                "sort": { "property": "sizeKib", "order": "desc" },
                "max": 3
            },
            "partitions": [
                {
                    "search": {
                        "condition": {
                            "and": [
                                { "property": "id", "value": "linux" },
                                { "property": "sizeGib", "value": 1, "operator": "greater" }
                            ]
                        }
                    },
                    "delete": true
                },
                {
                    "alias": "newRaidPart",
                    "id": "raid",
                    "size": { "min": "1 GiB" }
                }
              ]
        }
    ]
}
```

The example also serves to illustrate the scope of each search. That is, the devices from the system
that are considered as possible candidates. That obviously depends on the place in the profile of
the `search` section.  A `search` section inside the description of an MD RAID will only match MD
devices and a `search` section inside the `partitions` subsection of that RAID description will only
match partitions of RAIDs that have matched the conditions of the most external `search`.

A given device can never match two different sections of the Agama profile. When several sections
at the same level contain a search subsection, devices are matched in the order the sections appear
on the profile.

```json
"storage": {
    "drives": [
        {
            "search": {
                "sort": { "property": "sizeKib", "order": "desc" },
                "max": 1
            },
            "alias": "biggest"
        },
        {
            "search": {
                "sort": { "property": "sizeKib", "order": "desc" },
                "max": 1
            },
            "alias": "secondBiggest"
        }
    ]
}
```

An empty search will match all devices in the scope, so the following example would delete all the
partitions of the chosen disk.

```json
"storage": {
    "drives": [
        {
            "partitions":
                { "search": {}, "delete": true }
        }
     ]
}
```

If there is not a single system device matching the scope and the conditions of a given search, then
`ifNotFound` comes into play. If the value is "skip", the device definition is ignored. If it's
"error" the whole process is aborted. The value "create", which cannot be used for a drive, will
cause the `search` section to be ignored if no device matches. As a consequence, a new logical
device (partition, LVM, etc.) will be created.

Entries on `drives` are different to all other subsections describing devices because drives can
only be matched to existing devices, they cannot be simply created. If `search` is omitted for a
drive, it will be considered to contain the following one.

```json
{
    "search": {
        "sort": { "property": "name" },
        "max": 1,
        "ifNotFound": "error"
    }
}
```

#### Under Discussion

Very often, `search` will be used to find a device by its name. In that case, the syntax could be
simplified to just contain the device name as string.

```json
{ "search": "/dev/sda" }
```

Using a string as value for `search` may also be useful in other situations. Special values could be
used as aliases for typical cases:

  - Empty string or "\*" to match all devices (the same than an empty section)
  - Something like "next" to represent the default search for drives (see above)

If a simple string like "next" could be used to specify the standard search entry for drives, it
would make sense to simply make `search` mandatory for all drives instead of assuming a default one.

Another possible improvement for that string-based format would be supporting regular expressions.
That would make it possible to use searchers like this.

```json
{ "search": ".*" }
```

But regular expressions would not play well with libstorage-ng. Since not all device names are
stored in the devicegraph, it is is necessary to use functions like `find_by_any_name` in order to
perform an exhaustive search by name.

Another apect under discussion is the format to specify conditions. Instead of the format described
above, it would be possible to use the key as name of the property, resulting in something like this.

```json
{
    "search": {
        "condition": { "sizeGib": 1, "operator": "greater" }
    }
}
```

### Referencing Other Devices

Sometimes is necessary to reference other devices as part of the specification of an LVM volume
group or RAID. Those can be existing system devices or devices that will be created as response to
another entry of the Agama profile.

Aliases can be used for that purpose as shown in this example.

```json
"storage": {
    "drives": [
        {
            "partitions":
                { "size": "50 GiB", "id": "lvm", "alias": "newPV" }
        }
     ],
     "volumeGroups": [
        {
            "name": "newVG",
            "physicalVolumes": [ "newPV" ],
            "logicalVolumes": [ { "name": "data", "size": "20 GiB" } ]
        }
    ]
}
```

If a section that matches several existing devices contains an alias, that alias will be considered
to be a reference to all the devices. As a consequence, this two examples are equivalent.

```json
"storage": {
    "drives": [
        {
            "search": {
                "sort": { "property": "sizeKib", "order": "desc" },
                "max": 1,
            },
            "alias": "biggest"
        },
        {
            "search": {
                "sort": { "property": "sizeKib", "order": "desc" },
                "max": 1,
            },
            "alias": "secondBiggest"
        }
    ],
    "mdRaids": [
        {
            "devices": [ "biggest", "secondBiggest" ],
            "level": "raid0"
        }
    ]
}

"storage": {
    "drives": [
        {
            "search": {
                "sort": { "property": "sizeKib", "order": "desc" },
                "max": 2,
                "min": 2
            },
            "alias": "big"
        }
    ],
    "mdRaids": [
        {
            "devices": [ "big" ],
            "level": "raid0"
        }
    ]
}
```

#### Under Discussion

In addition to aliases, a `search` section could be accepted in all the places in which an alias can
be used. In that case, the scope of the search would always be the whole set of devices in the
system (so the same conditions can be matched by a disk, a partition, an LVM device, etc.) and
`ifNotFound` could not be set to "create" (similar to what happens for drives in general).

```json
"storage": {
     "volume_groups": [
        {
            "name": "newVG",
            "physicalVolumes": [
                { "search": { "condition": { "property": "name", "value": "/dev/sda2" } } }
            ],
            "logicalVolumes": [ { "name": "data", "size": "20 GiB" } ]
        }
    ]
}
```

### Keeping an Existing File System or Encryption Layer

The entries for both `encryption` and `filesystem` contain a flag `reuse` with a default value of
false. It can be used in combination with `search` to specify the device must not be re-encrypted
or re-formatted.

### Deleting and Shrinking Existing Devices

The storage proposal must make possible to define what to do with existing partitions and logical
volumes. Even with existing MD RAIDs or LVM volume groups.

A `search` section allows to match the definition of a partition or an LVM logical volume with one
(or several) devices existing in the system. In order to provide the same capabilities than the
Guided proposal (see below) it must be possible to specify that a given partition or volume must be:

  - Deleted if needed to make space for the newly defined devices
  - Deleted in all cases
  - Shrunk to the necessary size to make space for new devices
  - Shrunk or extended to a given size, maybe a range (not really possible in the current Guided
    Proposal)

It is even possible to express some combinations of the above, like "try to shrink it to make space
but proceed to delete it if shrinking it is not enough".

Deletion can be achieved with the corresponding `delete` flag or the alternative `deleteIfNeeded`.
If any of those flags are active for a partition, it makes no sense to specify any other usage
(like declaring a file system on it).

The following example deletes the partition with the label "root" in all cases and, if needed, keeps
deleting other partitions as needed to make space for the new partition of 30 GiB.

```json
"storage": {
    "drives": [
        {
            "partitions": [
                {
                    "search": {
                        "condition": { "property": "fsLabel", "value": "root" }
                    },
                    "delete": true
                },
                { "search": {}, "deleteIfNeeded": true },
                { "size": "30 GiB" }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

Often some partitions or logical volumes are shrunk only to make space for the declared devices. But
since resizing is not a destructive operation, it can also make sense to declare a given partition
must be resized (shrunk or extended) and then formatted and/or mounted.

In any case, note that resizing a partition can be limited depending on its content, the filesystem
type, etc.

Combining `search` and `resize` is enough to indicate Agama is expected to resize a given partition
if possible. The keyword "current" can be used eveywhere a size is expected and it is always
equivalent to the exact original size of the device. The simplest way to use "current" is to just
specify that the matched device should keep its original size. That's the default for searched (and
found) devices if `size` is completely omitted.

```json
"storage": {
    "drives": [
        {
            "partitions": [
                {
                    "search": {
                        "condition": { "property": "fsLabel", "value": "reuse" }
                    },
                    "size": "current"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

Using "current" for the min and max values of a size allows to specify how a device could be resized
if possible. See the following examples with explanatory filesystem labels.

```json
"storage": {
    "drives": [
        {
            "partitions": [
                {
                    "search": {
                        "condition": { "property": "fsLabel", "value": "shrinkIfNeeded" }
                    },
                    "size": { "min": 0, "max": "current" }
                },
                {
                    "search": {
                        "condition": { "property": "fsLabel", "value": "resizeToFixedSize" }
                    },
                    "size": "15 GiB"
                },
                {
                    "search": {
                        "condition": { "property": "fsLabel", "value": "resizeByRange" }
                    },
                    "size": { "min": "10 GiB", "max": "50 GiB" }
                },
                {
                    "search": {
                        "condition": { "property": "fsLabel", "value": "growAsMuchAsPossible" }
                    },
                    "size": { "min": "current" }
                },
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

Of course, when the size limits are specified as a combination of "current" and a fixed value, the
user must still make sure that the resulting min is not bigger than the resulting max.

Both `deleteIfNeeded` and a size range can be combined to indicate that Agama should try to make
space first by shrinking the partitions and deleting them only if shrinking is not enough.

```json
"storage": {
    "drives": [
        {
            "partitions": [
                {
                    "search": {},
                    "size": { "min": 0, "max": "current" },
                    "deleteIfNeeded": true
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

### Using the Automatic Proposal

On the first implementations, Agama can rely on the process known as Guided Proposal to calculate
all the needed partitions, LVM devices and file systems based on some general product settings and
some user preferences. That mechanism is offered as a temporary alternative to the more descriptive
syntax explained at previous sections of this document and it's implemented via a `guided` section
that conforms to the following specification.

```
Guided
  device [TargetDevice]
  boot [BootSettings]
  encryption [EncryptionSettings]
  space <'delete'|'resize'|'keep'>
  volumes [Volume[]]

TargetDevice <string|TargetDisk|TargetNewLvm|TargetReusedLvm>

TargetDisk
  disk <string>

TargetNewLvm
  newLvmVg <string[]>

TargetReusedLvm
  reusedLvmVg <string>

Volume
  mountPath <string>
  mountOptions <string>
  filesystem <string>
  autoSize <boolean>
  minSize <string>
  maxSize <string>
  snapshots <Boolean>
  target <VolumeTarget>

VolumeTarget <'default'|NewPartition|NewVg|UseDevice|UseFilesystem>

NewPartition
  newPartition <string>

NewVg
  newVg <string>

UseDevice
  device <string>

UseFilesystem
  filesystem <string>
```

The `device` can be specified in several ways. The simplest one is using one of the strings "disk"
or "newLvmVg". In that case, the proposal will automatically select the first disk to be used as
target disk or as base to create the physical volumes. For example, this will create a default
partition-based installation on the first available disk.

```json
"storage": {
    "guided": { "device": "disk" }
}
```

And this will do the same, but creating a new LVM volume group on that first candidate disk.

```json
"storage": {
    "guided": { "device": "newLvmVg" }
}
```

It's also possible to use a device name to specify a concrete disk...

```json
"storage": {
    "guided": {
        "device": {
            "disk": "/dev/sda"
        }
    }
}
```

or to specify the set of disks where the LVM physical volumes can be created.

```json
"storage": {
    "guided": {
        "device": {
            "newLvmVg": ["/dev/vda", "/dev/vdb"]
        }
    }
}
```

Apart from specifying the main target device, device names must be used wherever a device is
expected, eg. when indicating a special target for a given volume.

In principle, the list of volumes will have the same format than the existing HTTP API used by
the UI for calculating the storage proposal. That is, if the list is not provided the default
volumes will be created and if some aspects are omitted for a given volume they will be completed
with default values. In the future we may consider more advanced mechanisms to include or exclude
some given volumes or to customize a single volume without having to provide the full list of
volume mount paths.

The `guided` section makes it possible to achieve the same results than using the Agama user
interface with only one exception. The Agama UI allows to indicate that a given set of partitions
can be resized if needed to allocate the volumes, without actually indicating how much those
partitions should be resized. The Guided Proposal algorithm decides whether to resize and how much
based on the other settings. Currently there is no way to express that in the auto-installation
profile.
