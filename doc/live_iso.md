Agama installer is deployed as a regular application which can be installed and run on a local system. However, the most expected way of using Agama is by running it on a live ISO image.

## Sources

The Live ISO sources are maintained in the [live](../live/) subdirectory,
See more details in a [live/README.md](../live/README.md) documentation.

## Live ISO Requirements

A live ISO for running Agama should provide the following software:

* Hardware drivers.
* Agama installer and related tools (lvm, cryptsetup, networkmanager, etc).
* A browser to locally render the Agama web UI.
* Optionally, repository packages of the products to install.

Notes:

* If no browser is included, then the installation has to be remotely performed by using a browser from another machine. This would be the typical case for s390x installations.
* If no repositories are included, then the installation would require internet connection to download the packages of the product to install.

## Agama Live ISO (*only for development and testing*)

The Agama project provides a [live ISO image](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/systemsmanagement:Agama:Devel/agama-live) for testing purposes and it is intended to be used for developers only. It has some limitations and it is not optimized for production usage.

**Disclaimer: Agama project is focused on develop the Agama installer applications. Generating and optimizing production ready live ISO images for both SUSE and openSUSE projects is out of the scope.**

### Description

* The live ISO is based on openSUSE Tumbleweed.
* Allows installing both SUSE and openSUSE products.
* Weighs around 1 GiB.
* Contains Agama installer and tools, and hardware drivers.
* **Includes Firefox (except for ppc64le and s390x).**
* **Does not include packages from product repositories.**
* Supported archs: x86_64, aarch64, ppc64le and s390x.

Notes:

* Firefox is compiled for [ppc64le in Factory](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/openSUSE:Factory:PowerPC/MozillaFirefox), but it is not included in the repositories of ALP and openSUSE products.
* Firefox is not compiled for s390x.
* For both ppc64le and s390x a browser from a remote machine has to be used in order to run the Agama web UI. Auto-installation and CLI equally works in all architectures.
* An internet connection is always required to download the packages of the product to install.

### Hardware Requirements

* 2 GiB of RAM memory
* Internet connection to download packages of the product to install.
* Around 10 GiB of disk size, although it depends on the selected product to install.

## Experimental Self-update

> [!WARNING]
> This feature is experimental and untested!

The Agama packages on the Live ISO can be automatically updated from the OBS
Staging project.

* Use the `agama.self_update` boot parameter to run the self-update
automatically during boot.
* Or run the `agama-self-update` script anytime later in a running Live system.

> [!NOTE]
> After updating the packages the Agama servers need to be restarted. This will
> reset all you current Agama settings, you will need to start from scratch!

## The Access Password

Because the ISO image is built publicly we cannot use any predefined password as
everybody would know that and for attackers it would be really trivial to hack
your running installer.

That means you have to provide our own password. If none is specified then Agama
generates a random password and prints it on the console after boot.

### Using Custom Password

There are several ways how to specify your custom password, each of them might
be suitable for a different use case.

### Boot Command Line

You can define the password directly on the boot command line. There are two
options:

* Use `live.password=<password>` with a plain text password.

* Use `live.password_hash=<password_hash>` with a hashed password. This is more
  secure than using a plaintext password.

  The disadvantage is that the hashed password is quite long and is not easy to
  type it into the boot prompt manually. It makes sense in environments where
  you can prepare the boot parameters in advance like in PXE boot or some
  virtual machines.

  See more details about creating a hashed password [below](
  #creating-a-hashed-password).

### Interactive Input

You can enter your password during boot in an interactive session. Again, there
are two options:

* Use `live.password_dialog` boot option to start an interactive dialog during
  the boot process. This uses a nice dialog for entering and confirming the
  password. However, in some situations the full screen dialog might not be
  displayed correctly or some messages might be displayed over it. In that case
  you might use the `Ctrl+L` key shortcut to refresh the screen. If it still
  does not work then try using the other option below.

* Use `live.password_systemd` boot option to ask for the password in a simple
  prompt. This is similar to the option above, but the advantage is that this
  solution does not use a full screen dialog but a single line prompt so it
  should work better in special environments like a serial console.

The Agama and the SSH server are not started until a password is configured.
This avoid using the default password from the medium accidentally.

### Injecting the Default Password Into the ISO Image

Another option is to inject your custom hashed password directly into the ISO
image. The advantage is than you can easily use the same image for installing
multiple machines and you do not need to configure anything during the boot.

To inject a new password into the ISO run:

```sh
# replace the agama.iso name with your image name
tagmedia --add-tag "live_password=$((openssl passwd -6) | base64 -w 0)" agama.iso
```

It will interactively ask for a password then it will be hashed using the SHA512
algorithm, encoded to the Base64 encoding and appended to the application area
in the ISO file. If you want to update the password then just the same command
again, it will overwrite the existing password.

See the [Creating a Hashed Password](#creating-a-hashed-password) section below
if you want to use a different hashing algorithm than SHA512.

To check all tags present in an ISO file use this command:

```sh
# replace the agama.iso name with your image name
tagmedia agama.iso
```

If you want to remove the password setting from the ISO image then run:

```sh
# replace the agama.iso name with your image name
tagmedia --remove-tag live_password agama.iso
```

> [!CAUTION]
> The image usually already contains some other tags, like the checksums for
> verifying the medium integrity. Do not touch them!

### Random Password as a Fallback

When no password is specified or entering the password interactively was
canceled by the user then Agama generates a random password and prints it on the
console.

### Password Priority

The password setting priority is following (from highest priority to the
lowest):

1. Password entered interactively during the boot process
2. Password entered on the boot command line
3. Default password from the ISO image meta data
4. A random password is generated as a fallback

### Creating a Hashed Password

There are several ways how to create a password hash, here we will mention two
tools.

Each tool allows to select the encryption method to use. To check the details
about all encryption methods see `man 5 crypt`, it lists the encryption methods
sorted by their strength so you can check which methods are recommended and
which ones should be avoided.

#### Mkpasswd

You can use the `mkpasswd` tool from the `whois` package. It offers a lot of
encryption methods, see the `mkpasswd -m help` for the list.

By default it uses the strongest method available so in most cases you just run

```sh
mkpasswd
```

and then enter the password on the command line prompt.

#### OpenSSL

Alternatively you can use the `openssl passwd` command from the openSSL package.
It offers less encryption methods but on the other hand it should be basically
installed in every system.

> [!WARNING]
> By default it uses a weak encryption method (DES or MD5 depending on the OpenSSL
> version) so you should always provide an additional encryption method parameter
> to select a stronger encryption!

To create a SHA512 hash for your password run

```sh
openssl passwd -6
```

and then enter the password on the command line prompt.

For less strong SHA256 hash use the `-5` option, the other encryption methods
should be avoided.
