org.opensuse.Agama1.Questions:
@short_description: Questions from the backend to the user, the manager object

Agama offers a mechanism to communicate with clients. The D-Bus service exports a *Questions*
object that implements the *org.freedesktop.DBus.ObjectManager* interface. Individual questions are
dynamically exported in a tree under the */org/opensuse/Agama1.Questions* path, for example:

<programlisting>
/org/opensuse/Agama1/Questions
  /org/opensuse/Agama1/Questions/1
  /org/opensuse/Agama1/Questions/2
  /org/opensuse/Agama1/Questions/4
</programlisting>

Each D-Bus question implements its own set of interfaces, depending on the type of question. For
example, a generic question implements *org.opensuse.Agama.Question1*. And a question asking
for the activation of a LUKS device also implements *org.opensuse.Agama1.Questions.WithPassword*.
Questions can be "unexported" from the ObjectManager tree. The service typically unexports a question
when the question is answered and the answer is successfully read.
