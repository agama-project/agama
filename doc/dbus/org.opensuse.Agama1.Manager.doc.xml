        InstallationPhases:

  All possible phases:
<programlisting>
[
    {"id" => 0, "label" => "startup"},
    {"id" => 1, "label" => "config"},
    {"id" => 2, "label" => "install"}
]
</programlisting>

The installation process follows a set of phases. Only the main service (`Agama::Manager`)
knows the information about the current installation phase. The rest of services will act as utility
services without any knowledge about the whole installation process.

A client (e.g., a web UI) will ask to the main service for the current phase of the installation.

In principle, the installation will follow 3 possible phases: *Startup*, *Config* and *Install*.

* *Startup* Phase:
This is the initial phase. The manager service will start in this phase and it will not change to
another phase until the client asks for performing the next phase.

* *Config* Phase:
The installation is configured during this phase. Configuring the installation means that everything
needed from the system is read and the required default proposal are calculated. In YaST terms, the
*config* phase implies to probe some modules like storage, language, etc, and to perform their
proposals. Note that not all modules have to be probed/proposed. Probing some modules could be
delayed to the next *install* phase.

* *Install* Phase:
This phase implies to perform everything to install the system according to the selected options and
proposals. Note that this phase is not only a typical YaST commit. For example, some proposals
(software?) could be done during this phase. In short, at the beginning of this phase we have all
the required information to perform the installation, and at the end of the phase the system is
installed.

        Note that the services are blocked meanwhile they are performing a long task. For this
        reason, the *manager* service will store the status of each service and the clients will ask to
        *manager* to know that status.
