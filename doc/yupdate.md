# Patching the Agama on a Live Medium

The Agama installer allows patching itself directly from the GitHub sources
or from your local Git checkout using the [yupdate script](
https://github.com/yast/yast-installation/blob/master/bin/yupdate).
See more details in the [yupdate documentation](
https://github.com/yast/yast-installation/blob/master/doc/yupdate.md).

This patching only works when running from a live medium. You can also patch
the standard YaST modules included in the installer if needed.

The goal is to provide an easy way for testing fixes or new features for the
end users or testers.

## Patching from GitHub

```
yupdate patch openSUSE/agama master
```

You can replace the `master` branch with any branch containing a fix or a new feature.

## Patching from a Local Git Checkout

First you need to run the `rake server` command in your Agama Git checkout.

Then run this command:

```
yupdate patch 192.168.1.2:8000
```

Replace the IP address with the IP address of your machine running the
`rake server` command. Port 8000 is the default port used, modify it if you use
a different port number.

## Options

You can modify the update process with these environment variables:

- `DEBUG=1` - to find more about what is going behind process. If it fails in
  rake install see VERBOSE below.
- `VERBOSE` - makes visible all commands and its output when doing rake
  install. Useful to debug if yupdate failed.
- `NPM_CACHE=1` - The installed NPM packages will be saved to a local cache
  and will be reused in the next run. This can speed up the patching process
  if you need to patch the installer several times. On the other hand this
  increases the amount of needed RAM memory.
  The cache is stored in `$HOME/.cache/agama-devel/` directory,
  if you need to refresh the content of the cache then delete this directory.
- `NODE_ENV=development` - The web front-end will be built in the development
  mode. The files will not be minimized and additional `*.map` files will be
  generated. This helps with debugging in the browser, you can get the locations
  in the original source files.
- `YUPDATE_SKIP_FRONTEND=1` - Skip updating the web frontend. Use this option
  when you use the webpack development server for running the web frontend.
  In that case updating the web frontend does not make sense because it is
  running in a different server. This saves some time and disk/RAM space.
- `YUPDATE_SKIP_BACKEND=1` - Skip updating the D-Bus service backend. This is
  similar to the previous option, use it when you do want to keep the D-Bus
  service unchanged.

## Notes

For compiling the Javascript code and SCSS files the yupdate installs several
RPM and NPM packages. Because the live medium is completely running in a RAM
disk all downloaded files are stored in the RAM memory.

That means the machine should have enough memory for this process. If there
is not enough memory the system becomes completely frozen and might not respond
to any input event.

Currently the minimum for a safe operation is around 4GB RAM. If you use the
`NPM_CACHE=1` option then recommended minimum is around 5GB.

## Activating the Changes

After patching the files the DBus service is restarted if any related file
has been changed. That means the configured settings will be lost.

To activate the changes in the web frontend you need to reload the page in the
browser.

:warning: *In the FireFox browser you need to use the `Ctrl+F5` combination
for reloading the page, this uses full reload ignoring the cache. Plain `F5`
uses cached files and will not reflect the update on the server!*

In some special cases you might need to do some additional actions manually,
the update script might not handle all corner cases.

## Implementation Details

The support is implemented in the main [Rakefile](../Rakefile) and in the
[.yupdate.pre](../.yupdate.pre) and [.yupdate.post](../.yupdate.post) hook
scripts.

- The `.yupdate.pre` script prepares the system for compiling and installing
  new Agama files.
- The `Rakefile` code builds and installs both backend and frontend parts.
- The `.yupdate.pre` script activates the changes, it restarts the backend if needed.
