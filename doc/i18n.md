Internationalization (sometimes abbreviated as "i18n") is a process for
supporting different languages and locales in software. This documentation
describes how is that handled in Agama.

Each Agama part (the web frontend, the D-Bus backend and the command line
interface) needs to solve this problem separately, see more details for each
part in the details below.

## Using Translations

Users have two ways how to change the used language in the Agama interface.

### Language Selector

The sidebar of the web UI contains a component that allows to change the
language. It was introduced in Agama 5 and it is the recommended way. The list
of supported languages is read from the
[languages.json](https://github.com/openSUSE/agama/blob/master/web/src/languages.json)
file. Check the  [The Web Frontend](#the-web-frontend) for further details.

### URL Query Parameter

When using a remote installation it is possible to set the used language via an
URL query parameter. This is an expert option.

To change the language append the `?lang=<locale>` query to the URL when
accessing the Agama installer. The `locale` string uses the [RFC
5646](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5646.html) but the usual Linux locale
format is supported too, e.g. `cs_CZ`.

It is the user responsibility to use a correct locale name. When using a wrong
name the translations might be broken, displayed only partially or even not at
all.

Changing the language causes reloading the page, in some situations this could
cause losing some entered values on the current page. Therefore it is
recommended to change the language at the very beginning.

## Translations

For translation process Agama uses [Weblate](https://weblate.org/) tool running
at the [openSUSE](https://l10n.opensuse.org/) instance.

## The Workflow

The basic translation workflow looks like this:

1. The translatable texts are marked for translation in the source code, usually
   with the `_()` function or something similar
2. The translatable string are collected into a POT file which is uploaded to
   the staging [agama-weblate](https://github.com/agama-project/agama-weblate) GitHub
   repository
3. The POT file is loaded by the Weblate into the
   [agama](https://l10n.opensuse.org/projects/agama/) project
4. Translators then can translate the English texts into other languages
5. Weblate pushes back the translations in the PO files back to the
   [agama-weblate](https://github.com/agama-project/agama-weblate) repository
6. The translations in the PO files are regularly copied to the main repository
   using pull requests
7. The PO files are processed during build so the translations can be used
   later at runtime

## Staging Translation Repository

The special [agama-weblate](https://github.com/agama-project/agama-weblate)
repository works like a buffer between the Agama sources and the Weblate tool.

We do not want to spam the Weblate tool with every trivial change in the texts
and the other way round, we do not need to get dozen commits from the Weblate
every day with updated translations. This would be especially annoying
before releasing a new version where we might want to accept only unnecessary
changes to not break something at the very last minute.

The agama-weblate repository uses webhooks to notify the Weblate instance
of any change. Changes in the repository should be visible in Weblate in matter
of seconds.

## Synchronization

The content between the main [agama](https://github.com/openSUSE/agama) and
the translation [agama-weblate](https://github.com/agama-project/agama-weblate)
GitHub repositories is synchronized automatically using the GitHub Actions.

### Uploading Translatable Texts

Collecting and uploading the translatable texts is done by the
[weblate-update-pot.yml](
https://github.com/openSUSE/agama/blob/master/.github/workflows/weblate-update-pot.yml)
GitHub action.

- It checks out both `agama` and `agama-weblate` repositories
- It runs a script which extracts the translatable strings in the `agama`
  repository into a POT file
- The POT file is copied to the `agama-weblate` repository and committed to
  the GitHub repository

This action is run daily, but it can be started manually if needed.
Go to the [weblate-update-pot.yml](
https://github.com/openSUSE/agama/actions/workflows/weblate-update-pot.yml)
action detail and use the "Run workflow" option at the top of the page.

The code compares the old POT file with the new one and if there is no change
besides the timestamps in the file it is not uploaded to `agama-weblate`.

### Downloading Updated Translations

The translations from the `agama-weblate` repository are merged back by the
[weblate-merge-po.yml](
https://github.com/openSUSE/agama/blob/master/.github/workflows/weblate-merge-po.yml)
GitHub action.

- It checks out both `agama` and `agama-weblate` repositories
- It copies the PO files from the `agama-weblate` to the `agama` repository
- It updates the `languages.json` file with the list of supported languages.
- It creates a pull request with the changes

If there are no changes besides the timestamps in the PO files the pull request
is not created.

## Weblate Configuration

The [Agama Weblate](https://l10n.opensuse.org/projects/agama/) project defines a
separate translation component for each Agama part (the web frontend, the D-Bus
backend and the command line interface).

For reading the translations it uses the [agama-weblate](
https://github.com/agama-project/agama-weblate) GitHub repository, but for the source
code locations it uses the original [agama](https://github.com/openSUSE/agama)
repository. That means after clicking the source location link in the Weblate
you will see the correct source location in the other repository.

### Plugins

The Weblate components use the [msgmerge](
https://docs.weblate.org/en/weblate-4.9.1/admin/addons.html#addon-weblate-gettext-msgmerge)
plugin which automatically updates all PO files to match the POT file. That
means after adding or updating any translatable text the changes are
automatically applied to all existing PO files and translators can translate
the new or updated texts immediately.

## Technical Details

This part describes technical and implementation details. It also describes the
translation process for developers.

### The Web Frontend

Most of the translatable texts which can user see in Agama are defined in the
web frontend. However, the web frontend can display some translated texts coming
from the backend part so it is important to set the same language in both parts
and make sure the translations are available there.

The list of supported languages is read from the
[languages.json](https://github.com/openSUSE/agama/blob/master/web/src/languages.json).
Such a list is automatically refreshed when any of the PO files is updated (see
[Uploading Translatable Texts](#uploading-translatable-texts)).

The [update-manifest.py
script](https://github.com/openSUSE/agama/blob/master/web/share/update-manifest.py)
is the responsible for updating the list of supported languages. It goes
through all PO files, filters out the ones with less than 70% of translated
content and adds the corresponding locales to the `languages.json`.

The name of the locale is taken from
[langtable](https://pypi.org/project/langtable/), so be sure to have it
installed. However, when the territory is not include in the PO file (`es`
instead of `es_es`), the script uses the
[locales.json map](https://github.com/openSUSE/agama/blob/master/web/share/locales.json)
to determine which territory to use.

If you need to manually update the `languages.json` file, run:

```
web/share/update-languages.py > web/src/languages.json
```

### Marking Texts for Translation

The texts are marked for translation using the usual functions like `_()`,
`n_()` and others. It is similar to the GNU gettext style.

The mechanism of loading and displaying the translation is heavily inspired
in Cockpit's approach. The [i18n module](../web/src/i18n.js) offers a set of translation functions:


```js
import { _, n_, N_, Nn_ } from "~/i18n";
```

It is important to use these functions only on string literals! Do not use them
with string templates or string concatenation, that will not work properly.

The `_` and `n_` functions can be used on variables or constants, but their
content must marked for translation using the `N_` or `Nn_` functions
on string literals. See the examples below.

#### Singular Form

This is the most common way:

```js
const title=_("Storage");
```

For using translated text in React components you need to use curly braces
to switch to plain Javascript in the attributes and the content:

```js
<Section title={_("Storage")}></Section>
```

or

```js
<Button>{_("Select")}</Button>
```

For translating long texts you might use multiline string literals:

```js
const description = _("Select the device for installing the system. All the \
file systems will be created on the selected device.");
```

If you need to insert some values into the text you should use the
[formatting function](#formatting-texts). It is recommended to use
[translator comments](#translators-comments) for short or ambiguous texts.

#### Plural Form

If the translated text contains a number or quantity it is good to use a plural
form so the translated texts looks naturally.

```js
sprintf(
  // the first argument is a singular form used when errors.length === 1,
  // the second argument is used in all other cases
  n_("%d error found", "%d errors found", errors.length),
  errors.length
)
```

Although the English language has only a single plural form the translators can
use more of them. The translation definition also defines a function that
computes which plural form to use for a specific number. See more details about
the [plural forms](
https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/Plural-forms.html) in the
GNU gettext documentation.

#### Translating Constants

The top-level constants are evaluated too early, at that time the translations
are not available yet and the language is not set.

The constant value must be marked with `N_()` function which does nothing
and then later translated with the usual `_()` function.

```js
const LABELS = Object.freeze({
  auto: N_("Auto"),
  fixed: N_("Fixed"),
  range: N_("Range")
});

export default function Foo() {
  ...
  <label>{_(LABELS[value])}</label>
```

#### Formatting Texts

For formatting complex texts use the C-like `sprintf()` function.

```js
import { sprintf } from "sprintf-js";

sprintf(_("User %s will be created"), user)
```

See the [sprintf-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sprintf-js) documentation
for more details about the formatting specifiers.

*Note: You cannot use HTML tags in the translated texts, React automatically
escapes all special HTML characters like `<>&`. That is different to YaST
where we can use HTML tags in rich text messages.*

It is recommended to avoid building texts from several parts translated
separately. This is error prone because the translators will not see the
complete final text and might translate some parts inaccurately.

```js
// do NOT use this! it is difficult to translate the parts correctly
// so they build a nice text after merging
return <div>{_("User ")}<b>{user}</b>{_(" will be created")}</div>

// rather translate a complete text and then split it into parts
// TRANSLATORS: %s will be replaced by the user name
const [msg1, msg2] = _("User %s will be created").split("%s");
...
return <div>{msg1}<b>{user}</b>{msg2}</div>
```

Text splitting might be quite complex in some cases, but still should be
preferred.

```js
// TRANSLATORS: error message, the text in square brackets [] is a clickable link
const [msgStart, msgLink, msgEnd] = _("An error occurred. \
Check the [details] for more information.").split(/[[\]]/);
...
return <p>{msgStart}<a>{msgLink}</a>{msgEnd}</p>;
```

Building sentences from separate parts might be easy in English, but is some
other languages it might much more complex. Always assume that the target
language has more complex grammar and rules.

```js
// do NOT use this! it is difficult to translate "enabled" and "not enabled"
// differently in the target language!
const msgNot = enabled ? "" : _("not");
sprintf(_("Service is %s enabled"), msgNot);

// this is better
enabled ? _("Service is enabled") : _("Service is disabled");
```

#### TRANSLATORS Comments

You can use a special `TRANSLATORS` keyword in the comment preceding the text
marked for translation. All comments after the keyword are included in the
translations file, this should help the translator to correctly translate the
text.

```js
// this line is NOT included in the PO file
// TRANSLATORS: this line is included in the PO file,
// this line as well
_("Back")
```

The translators comments should be used especially for short texts to better
describe the meaning and the context of the message.

```js
// TRANSLATORS: button label, going back to the main page
_("Back")
```

Also the formatting placeholders should be always described.

```js
// TRANSLATORS: %s will be replaced by the user name
_("User %s will be created")
```

The JSX code does not support comments natively, you have to write them in curly
braces.

```js
<Button>
  {/* TRANSLATORS: button label */}
  {_("Remove")}
</Button>
```

But in the component attributes you can use usual Javascript comments.

```js
<TextInput
  id="port"
  name="port"
  value={data.port || ""}
  // TRANSLATORS: network port number
  label={_("Port")}
/>
```

The translators can change the order of the arguments if needed using additional
positional arguments. For example to change the order of the arguments in `"Foo
%s %s"` they can translate it as `"Bar %2$s %1$s"`.

### Missing Translations

Here are some code examples which might look correct at the first sight. They
even work, no crash. But there are still translation problems with them.

- Do not use Javascript string templates, that does not work at all
  (~~``_(`User ${user} will be created`)``~~), use a string formatting function
  for that (`sprintf(_("User %s will be created"), user)`).

- Use the translation functions only with string literals without any operators,
  texts like ~~`_("foo" + "bar")`~~ will not be extracted correctly to the POT
  file.

In both cases the strings will not be extracted to the POT file.

### ESLint Plugin

There is special ESLint plugin [eslint-plugin-agama-i18n](
https://github.com/openSUSE/eslint-plugin-agama-i18n) which ensures that a
string literal is passed to the translation functions. See more details there.

### Testing Language

The Agama web interface supports special testing `xx` language. That language
needs to be selected manually by adding the `?lang=xx` query string to the
server URL. With this setting the `_()` and `n_()` translation functions replace
all alphabetical characters by the `x` symbol.

This can be used for testing to find out the texts which are not marked for
translation. If a text is not replaced by the `x` symbols then either it is not
marked for translation or it comes from the backend and it should be translated
by the backend.

However, this is not perfect. It will replace also the texts mentioned in the
[missing translations](#missing-translations) section above but in reality
the there would be no translations available for them.

### Building POT File

The translatable strings are extracted from the source files by using the
standard `xgettext` tool. There is a helper script [build_pot](../web/build_pot)
which defines the needed parameters for the `xgettext` tool.

To build the POT file locally just run the script, it will save the output to
the `agama.pot` file.

### Loading Web UI Translations

The translations are loaded by the `<script src="po.js" defer></script>` HTML
code in the [index.html](../web/src/index.html) file. But there is no such file
in Agama but one `po.<LANG>.js` file per language, like `po.cs.js`.

The trick is that Agama's web server checks the `agamaLang` cookie sent in the
HTTP request header and returns the content from the respective file.

### Development Server

Because Agama serves the `po.js` file a bit differently as described in the
[](#loading-web-ui-translations) section above we need to implement this
logic also in the development server.

The [webpack-po-handler.js](../web/src/lib/webpack-po-handler.js) file
checks the language cookie and uses HTTP redirection to load the respective
language file. It uses redirection because the built translation files are only
available in the webpack memory. But the result is the same, the browser gets
a different content according to the currently configured language.

### Backend Locale

The Agama server exposes a `uiLocale` configuration option via the
`/api/l10n/locales/config` endpoint which defines the locale used by all the
 services.

The `uiLocale` property is a single global value shared by all connected clients.
That means it is possible to use only one language for all clients, if
more users connect to the server and uses a different UI language then there
will be race conditions and the other users might see the texts coming from the
backend in another language than expected.

This is a known limitation, we expect that only one user at a time will access
the Agama installer or if multiple users use the same server we expect that
they will be from the same team or company using the same language.

To check or set the locale you can use the `/api/l10n/locales/config` endpoint.
Alternatively, you can check (but not change) the current locale via D-Bus:


```shell
sudo busctl --address unix:path=/run/agama/bus get-property org.opensuse.Agama1 \
  /org/opensuse/Agama1/Locale org.opensuse.Agama1.Locale UILocale
``` 

#### Backend Translations

The backend might return texts from external components like `libstorage-ng`.
Make sure the translations for those components are also available for Agama,
e.g. the `libstorage-ng` translations are stored in the `libstorage-ng-lang`
package or the YaST translations are stored in `yast2-trans-<LANG>` packages.

## Troubleshooting

Here are some hints what to do when some untranslated text appears in the Agama
UI.

1. Check that the text is marked for translation, for a quick verification
   you might try setting the [testing language](#testing-language).
2. If the text comes from backend or the other parts check that the appropriate
   [language package](#backend-translations) is installed.
3. The text should be [extracted into the POT file](#building-pot-file)
4. The [agama.pot](
   https://github.com/agama-project/agama-weblate/blob/master/web/agama.pot) in the
   `agama-weblate` repository is up to date, if not then run the [Weblate Update
   POT](https://github.com/openSUSE/agama/actions/workflows/weblate-update-pot.yml)
   Github Action manually.
5. The text is translated in the [Weblate repository](
   https://l10n.opensuse.org/projects/agama/).
6. The translation is included in the respective PO file in the [agama-weblate](
   https://github.com/agama-project/agama-weblate) repository.
7. The PO file in the [agama](
   https://github.com/openSUSE/agama/tree/master/web/po) repository is up to
   date, if not the check whether there is an [open pull request](
   https://github.com/openSUSE/agama/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+label%3Atranslations+label%3Abot)
   with the change, if yes then check it and merge, if not then run the [Weblate
   Merge PO](https://github.com/openSUSE/agama/actions/workflows/weblate-merge-po.yml)
   GitHub Action manually, then check the created pull request.
8. The translated string should be present in the built packages, run
   `npm build` command and check the `dist/po.*.js` files, check the built RPM
   package.
9. The translations are loaded by the browser, check the content loaded for the
   `po.js` file.
10. Check the current language used in the browser, run `agama.language`
    command in the development tools console, check the `agamaLang` cookie
    value (run `document.cookie` command in the console).
11. Check the language used by the [Backend Locale](#backend-locale).
