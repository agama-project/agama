This directory contains product definitions for the Agama installer.

## Contribution

For updating the translations use the [Agama Weblate
project](https://l10n.opensuse.org/projects/agama/agama-products/). The changes
in the Weblate are automatically saved to the
[agama-weblate](https://github.com/agama-project/agama-weblate/products) repository
and later a pull request with the changes is automatically created for merging
the changes here.

Alternatively you can open a pull request against the
[agama-weblate](https://github.com/agama-project/agama-weblate/products) GitHub
repository. But that requires manual approving and merging, prefer using the
Weblate tool, it merges automatically.
