//! Implements the logic for the software service.
//!
//! This service is responsible for the software management of the installer. The service uses
//! Tokio's tasks for long-running operations (e.g., when reading the repositories). However, only
//! one of those operations can run at the same time. It works in this way by design, not because of
//! a technical limitation.
//!
//! A service is composed of two parts: the server and the client. The server handles the business
//! logic and receives the actions to execute using a channel. The client is a simple wrapper around
//! the other end of the channel.
//!
//! Additionally, a service might implement a monitor which listens for events and talks to the
//! server when needed.
