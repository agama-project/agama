//! # Interacting with Agama
//!
//! This library offers an API to interact with Agama services. At this point, the library allows:
//!
//! * Reading and writing [installation settings](install_settings::InstallSettings).
//! * Monitoring the [progress].
//! * Triggering actions through the [manager] (e.g., starting installation).
//!
//! ## Handling installation settings
//!
//! Let's have a look to the components that are involved when dealing with the installation
//! settings, as it is the most complex part of the library. The code is organized in a set of
//! modules, one for each topic, like [network], [software], and so on.
//!
//! Each of those modules contains, at least:
//!
//! * A settings model: it is a representation of the installation settings for the given topic. It
//! is expected to implement the [serde::Serialize], [serde::Deserialize] and
//! [agama_settings::settings::Settings] traits.
//! * A store: it is the responsible for reading/writing the settings to the service. Usually, it
//! relies on a D-Bus client for communicating with the service, although it could implement that
//! logic itself. Note: we are considering defining a trait for stores too.
//!
//! As said, those modules might implement additional stuff, like specific types, clients, etc.
