//! This crate implements the support for localization handling in Agama.
//! It takes care of setting the locale, keymap and timezone for Agama itself
//! and the target system.
//!
//! From a technical point of view, it includes:
//!
//! * The [UserConfig] struct that defines the settings the user can
//!   alter for the target system.
//! * The [Proposal] struct that describes how the system will look like after
//!   the installation.
//! * The [SystemInfo] which includes information about the system
//!   where Agama is running.
//! * An [specific event type](Event) for localization-related events.
//!
//! The service can be started by calling the [start_service] function, which
//! returns a [agama_utils::actors::ActorHandler] to interact with the system.
