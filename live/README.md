## Layout

This directory contains a set of files that are used to build the Agama Live ISO image.

- [src](src) subdirectory contains all source files which are copied unmodified to the OBS project
- [root](root) subdirectory contains files which are added to the Live ISO root system (inside the
  squashfs image)
- [root-openSUSE-PXE](root-openSUSE-PXE) subdirectory contains specific files for the openSUSE image used for the
  PXE boot, see a separate [PXE documentation](PXE.md) for more details about the PXE boot
- [config-cdroot](config-cdroot) subdirectory contains file which are copied to the uncompressed
  root of the ISO image, the files can be accessed just by mounting the ISO file or the DVD medium

## Building the Sources

To build the sources for OBS just run the

```shell
make
```

command. This will save the built source files into the `dist` subdirectory.

To start from scratch run

```shell
make clean
```

or just simply delete the `dist` subdirectory.

## Building the ISO Image

To build the ISO locally run the

```shell
make build
```

command. The built ISO image is saved to the `/var/tmp/build-root` directory, see the end of the
build for output for the exact ISO file name.

For building an ISO image you need a lot of free space at the `/var` partition. Make sure there is
at least 25GiB free space otherwise the build will fail.

### Build Options

By default this will build the openSUSE image. If you want to build another image then run

```shell
make build FLAVOR=<flavor>
# for building the openSUSE-PXE flavor:
make build FLAVOR=openSUSE-PXE
```

See the [_multibuild](src/_multibuild) file for the list of available build flavors.

By default it will use the
[systemsmanagement:Agama:Devel](https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/systemsmanagement:Agama:Devel)
OBS project. If you want to build using another project, like your fork, then delete the `dist`
directory and checkout the OBS project manually and run the build:

```shell
rm -rf dist
# replace <USER> with your OBS account name
osc co -o dist home:<USER>:branches:systemsmanagement:Agama:Devel agama-installer-openSUSE
make build
```

## Image Definition

The [KIWI](https://github.com/OSInside/kiwi) image builder is used by OBS to build the Live ISO. See
the [KIWI documentation](https://osinside.github.io/kiwi/index.html) for more details about the
build workflow and the `.kiwi` file format.

### KIWI Files

The main Kiwi source files are located in the [src](src) subdirectory:

- [agama-installer-openSUSE.kiwi](src/agama-installer-openSUSE.kiwi) is the main KIWI file which drives the ISO image build.
- [config.sh](src/config.sh) is a KIWI hook script which is called and the end of the build process,
  after all packages are installed but before compressing and building the image. The script runs in
  the image chroot and is usually used to adjust the system configuration (enable/disable services,
  patching configuration files or deleting not needed files).
- [_constraints](src/_constraints) file tells OBS to build the image on the hosts with enough
  resources (enough free disk space).
- [_multibuild](src/_multibuild) defines the image flavors (KIWI profiles) which are available to
  build
- [images.sh](src/images.sh) - injects a script which checks whether the machine has enough RAM when
  booting the Live ISO
- [fix_bootconfig](src/fix_bootconfig) - a special KIWI hook script which sets the boot
  configuration on S390 and PPC64 architectures.

## Image Configuration

The Live ISO is configured to allow using some features and allow running Agama there.

## GRUB2 Menu

grub.cfg, defining boot menu items of the Agama image, is generated by scripts stored in
[config-cdroot](https://github.com/openSUSE/agama/tree/master/live/config-cdroot).

Both x86_64 and aarch64 grub.cfg are basically copies of KIWI autogenerated grub.cfg.
The x86_64 grub.cfg contains UEFI fix for Booting from disk (Issue #1609).


### SSH Server

The SSH connection for the root user is enabled in the
[10_root_login.conf](root/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/10_root_login.conf) file.

### Autologin

Automatic root login and staring the graphical environment is configured in several files.

- [x11-autologin.service](src/etc/systemd/system/x11-autologin.service) uses `startx` to start an
  x11 session.
- `startx` runs the Icewm window manager via [.xinitrc](root/root/.xinitrc) file.
- Icewm autostarts Firefox via [startup](root/root/.icewm/startup) file.
- Icewm uses the usual YaST2 installation [preferences.yast2](root/etc/icewm/preferences.yast2)
  configuration file

### Firefox Profile

The default Firefox configuration is defined in the [profile](root/root/.mozilla/firefox/profile)
file. It disables several features which do not make sense in Live ISO like remembering the used
passwords.

### Dracut menu

The [98dracut-menu](live/root/usr/lib/dracut/modules.d/98dracut-menu) directory implements a simple
menu system for dracut. To activate it during boot add `rd.cmdline=menu` to the boot prompt. This is
similar to `rd.cmdline=ask` which gives you a simple one-line prompt to add boot options.

The dracut-cmdline-menu can currently set the `root` and `proxy` options. The settings are copied
(using a dracut pre-pivot hook) to the live system in
[cmdline-menu.conf](root/etc/cmdline-menu.conf).

There is also the complete command line in the [cmdline-full.conf](root/etc/cmdline-full.conf)
file - maybe it can useful at least for debugging.

For more details see [dracut.bootup(7)](https://man.archlinux.org/man/dracut.bootup.7.en),
[dracut-pre-pivot.service(8)](https://man.archlinux.org/man/extra/dracut/dracut-pre-pivot.service.8.en).

To arrange the dracut config in KIWI you have to adjust the default dracut config of the live
system. This is done in [config.sh](src/config.sh). You can also fill in a default network location
if one is defined for a product (currently not).

### Avahi/mDNS

The mDNS service allows resolving host names in the local network without a DNS server. That is
implemented by the `avahi-daemon` service which enabled in the [config.sh](src/config.sh) file and
installed in the `avahi` RPM package.

The mDNS protocol resolves the hosts in the `.local` domain.

#### The Default Hostname

By default the Agama live ISO sets the `agama` host name which can be used as `agama.local` full
hostname in URL.

The default hostname is set by the [agama-hostname](root/etc/systemd/system/agama-hostname.service)
service.

If the hostname is set via the `hostname=` boot parameter then the `agama` host name is not used,
the boot option takes precedence.

#### Service Advertisement

The Avahi HTTPS service announcement is configured via the Avahi
[agama.service](root/etc/avahi/services/agama.service) file

That allows scanning all running Agama instances in the local network with command:

```shell
avahi-browse -t -r _agama._sub._https._tcp
```

### The Default Cockpit/Agama TCP Port

The default Cockpit TCP port is 9090. That makes sense for the system management framework as the
default ports might be used by a running Apache or other web servers.

But Agama runs from a Live ISO where running a web server does not make much sense so we can safely
use the default HTTP(S) ports.

The default port is changed in the
[listen.conf](root/etc/systemd/system/cockpit.socket.d/listen.conf) file.

### Autoinstallation Support

The autoinstallation is started using the [agama-auto](root/etc/systemd/system/agama-auto.service)
service which starts the [auto.sh](root/usr/bin/auto.sh) script. This script downloads the
installation profile, applies it to Agama and starts the installation.

### Firmware Cleanup

The [fw_cleanup.rb](root/tmp/fw_cleanup.rb) script removes the unused firmware from the image. Many
firmware files are not needed, this makes the final ISO much smaller.

This script is started from [config.sh](src/config.sh) the script and after running it the script
deleted. (Not needed anymore in the system.)
