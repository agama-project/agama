End User License Agreement for SUSE Software

BY PURCHASING, INSTALLING, DOWNLOADING OR OTHERWISE USING THE 
SOFTWARE (AS DEFINED BELOW), YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS 
AGREEMENT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THESE TERMS, YOU ARE NOT 
PERMITTED TO DOWNLOAD, INSTALL OR USE THE SOFTWARE. AN INDIVIDUAL 
ACTING ON BEHALF OF AN ENTITY REPRESENTS THAT HE OR SHE HAS THE 
AUTHORITY TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT ON BEHALF OF THAT ENTITY. IF 
YOU ARE ACCEPTING THE AGREEMENT ON BEHALF OF AN ENTITY, THEN THE 
TERMS "YOU" AND "YOUR" REFER TO THAT ENTITY WHENEVER USED BELOW.
SUSE Software Solutions Ireland Limited ("Licensor" or "SUSE") or 
its affiliates make available software products, which may include: 
(i) software developed by SUSE and/or its affiliates; (ii) software 
developed by third parties; (iii) compilations of software; and (iv) 
trade marks owned by SUSE and/or its affiliates ("SUSE Marks"), as 
well as documentation accompanying such software and configuration, 
compilation and packaging materials (such software, compilations of 
software programs, trade marks and documentation are, together with 
any associated configuration, compilation and packaging materials, 
the "Software"). This End User License Agreement ("EULA") is a legal 
agreement between You (a legal entity or a person) and SUSE and 
governs Your use of the Software. Any add-on, extension, update, 
mobile application, module, adapter or support release to the 
Software that You may download or receive that is not accompanied by 
another license agreement is licensed under this EULA. 
Definitions and interpretation
If the laws of Your principal place of business require contracts to 
be in the local language to be enforceable, You may request a local 
language version and, to the extent required by mandatory law, that 
local language version will prevail.
"Open Source Components" means software components distributed with 
or as part of the Software that are licensed by third parties under 
licences recognized as open source licences (each an "OSS License"). 
References to "use" include installation, execution and internal 
operation.
License Terms
Open Source
Software includes Open Source Components. The applicable OSS License 
for each Open Source Component is included in the accompanying 
licensing documentation and/or in the component's source code or 
notice file. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this EULA 
limits, supersedes or modifies Your rights under any OSS License. 
Your rights to use, copy, modify and redistribute Open Source 
Components are governed solely by the applicable OSS Licenses. If 
You redistribute Open Source Components, You are responsible for 
complying with the applicable OSS Licenses, including any notice and 
source code availability obligations described in the OSS notice 
file that accompanies the Software or is otherwise made available by 
SUSE on request.
The Software may be provided with third party programs that are not 
part of the Software. These third party programs are not required to 
run the Software, are provided as a convenience to you, and are 
subject to their own license terms. The license terms either 
accompany the third party programs or can be viewed at the location 
specified by their licensors. If you do not agree to abide by the 
applicable license terms for the third party programs, then you 
should not install or use them. 
License to use the Software
Subject to compliance with the terms and conditions of this EULA and 
of the applicable OSS Licenses, you are granted a perpetual, 
non-exclusive, non-transferable, irrevocable, worldwide license to 
reproduce and use copies of theSoftware for Your legal entity's 
internal use. This license grant does not apply to Open Source 
Components within the Software, which are licensed under their 
respective OSS Licenses. You may redistribute Open Source Components 
of the Software, without SUSE Marks, subject to their applicable OSS 
Licenses. 
Ownership
The Software is licensed, not sold. No title to or ownership of the 
Software is transferred to You. Licensor and/or the third party 
licensors retain all right, title and interest in and to all 
intellectual property rights in the Software.
SUSE Marks
No right or license, express or implied, is granted under this EULA 
to use any SUSE Mark, trade name or service mark of Licensor or its 
affiliates or licensors. You must remove SUSE Marks from any 
redistribution unless expressly authorised.
Subscription Services and Support
Licensor has no obligation to provide maintenance or support unless 
otherwise agreed pursuant to an additional agreement that expressly 
includes such services. Any such services are provided under 
separate terms and do not modify this EULA.
Warranty and Liability
Limited Warranty
THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND. 
EXCEPT AS RESTRICTED BY LAW, SUSE DISCLAIMS ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES, 
INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE 
AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. SUSE DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL 
MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, BE COMPATIBLE WITH YOUR SYSTEMS, OR OPERATE 
UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW CERTAIN 
DISCLAIMERS AND LIMITATIONS OF WARRANTIES, SO THE ABOVE MAY NOT 
FULLY APPLY. THIS CLAUSE DOES NOT LIMIT ANY RIGHTS YOU MAY HAVE 
UNDER APPLICABLE OSS LICENSES OR UNDER MANDATORY LAW.
Limitation of Liability
NEITHER LICENSOR NOR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES, SHAREHOLDERS, DIRECTORS, 
OR EMPLOYEES WILL IN ANY CASE BE LIABLE FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL OR 
INDIRECT DAMAGES, WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, TORT OR 
OTHER THEORY OF LIABILITY, OR FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, BUSINESS OR 
LOSS OR CORRUPTION OF DATA, IN EACH CASE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE 
POSSIBILITY OF THOSE DAMAGES. Subject to liabilities that cannot be 
excluded by law, each party's total aggregate liability arising out 
of or in connection with this EULA (whether in one instance or a 
series of instances) is limited to USD 50. Nothing in this EULA 
limits liability for death or personal injury caused by negligence, 
for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation, or for any other 
liability that cannot be excluded by law.
General Terms
Law
If Your principal place of business is in the United Kingdom or the 
European Economic Area, this EULA is governed by the laws of Ireland 
and the courts of Ireland shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any 
proceedings arising out of or relating to it. For all other 
customers, this EULA is governed by the laws of the State of New 
York and the federal and state courts located in New York have 
exclusive jurisdiction. This EULA is intended for business users and 
nothing in it affects the application of any mandatory laws that 
cannot be contracted out of. Neither the Uniform Computer 
Information Transaction Act, the United Nations Convention of 
Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, nor the New York, 
Irish or England and Wales conflict of law rules apply to this EULA 
or its subject matter.
Export Control and Sanctions
While the majority of SUSE's Materials are made publicly available, 
some Software may be subject to export control and sanctions laws 
and regulations of the United States, the European Union and other 
jurisdictions. 
You represent that you: (a) are not located in, organized in, and 
will not access SUSE Materials from, any country or region subject 
to comprehensive sanctions; (b) are not listed on, owned or 
controlled by, or acting for or on behalf of any party on any 
applicable government restricted party list; and (c) will not use 
SUSE Materials for any prohibited end use. You will comply with all 
applicable export control and sanctions laws and obtain any required 
authorizations before exporting, reexporting, transferring, or 
providing access to SUSE Materials.
SUSE may suspend, withhold, or terminate access to SUSE Materials 
where necessary to comply with applicable export control or 
sanctions laws. 
Entire Agreement
This EULA, together with any other purchase documents or other 
written agreement between You and Licensor or its affiliates, sets 
forth the entire understanding and agreement between You and 
Licensor and may be amended or modified only by a written agreement 
agreed to by You and an authorized representative of Licensor. NO 
THIRD PARTY LICENSOR, DISTRIBUTOR, DEALER, RETAILER, RESELLER, SALES 
PERSON, OR EMPLOYEE IS AUTHORIZED TO MODIFY THIS AGREEMENT OR TO 
MAKE ANY REPRESENTATION OR PROMISE THAT IS DIFFERENT FROM, OR IN 
ADDITION TO, THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. In the event of conflict 
between this EULA and an OSS License applicable to an Open Source 
Component, the OSS License will govern as to that Open Source 
Component.
Severability
If any provision in this EULA is invalid or unenforceable, that 
provision will be construed, limited, modified or, if necessary, 
severed, to the extent necessary, to eliminate its invalidity or 
unenforceability, and the other provisions of this EULA will remain 
unaffected.
Notices and Source Code Offer
OSS Licenses and attributions for Open Source Components are 
identified in the OSS notice file accompanying the Software. Where 
SUSE distributes binaries of components that require an offer for 
corresponding source code, SUSE will make the corresponding source 
available as described in the notice file or upon request.
