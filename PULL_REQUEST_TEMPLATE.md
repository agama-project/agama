## Documentation

*Remember to look at it from the user's perspective. Yes you have made the compiler happy.*
*But will the **humans** even know about your contribution? Sometimes they cannot miss it,*
*other times they need advertisement and explanation.*

*Look for relevant sections and adjust:*
- The description parts of the [JSON schema][profile.schema.json]
- Is the CLI affected? See [cli.md][] for a complete overview,
  change the `///` comments (rust doc)
  and update the .md with `cargo xtask markdown`
- <https://agama-project.github.io/> ([source][gh.io])
- Run: `git ls-files '*.md'`
