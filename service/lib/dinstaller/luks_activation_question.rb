  # This class represent a question to ask whether to activate a LUKS device
  #
  # Clients have to answer one of these options:
  #   * skip: to skip the activation of the LUKS device
  #   * decrypt: to activate the device using the provided password
  #
  # @example
  #   question = LuksActivationQuestion.new("/dev/sda1", label: "mydata", size: "10 GiB")
  #   question.password = "n0ts3cr3t"
  #
  #   question.answer = :skip    # in case you do not want to activate the device
  #
  #   question.answer = :decrypt # in case you want to decrypt with the given password
