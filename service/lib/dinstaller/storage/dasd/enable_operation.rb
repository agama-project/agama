          # But dasd_configure does a couple of extra things we still find valuable:
          #   - It checks whether the device really goes online, using a reasonable timeout
          #   - It writes the CIO channel of the device to /boot/zipl/active_devices.txt (we are
          #     not sure whether this is relevant in our case, bsc#1095033 seems to suggest it is).
