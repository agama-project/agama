      # NOTE: this mimics to a big extent the YaST behavior regarding the management of the
      # use_diag flag for a given DASD. YaST behavior have the following particularities:
      #
      #   - When the value of the DIAG flag is changed for an enabled device, the change is applied
      #     immediately, disabling the device and enabling it again with the new value.
      #   - When the value of DIAG is changed for a disabled device, the new wanted value is stored
      #     by YaST in memory but not written to the system configuration. The change will only
      #     have effect if the device is enabled afterwards during the same YaST execution (lost
      #     if YaST quits without ever enabling the device).
      #   - In the UI, DIAG is always displayed as 'no' for disabled devices. For enabled devices
      #     the correct/current value is displayed.
