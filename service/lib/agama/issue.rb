module Agama
  # This class represents an issue in Agama
  #
  # An issue is used for notifying about some unexpected or problematic situation, for example, to
  # indicate that there is no device for installing the system.
  #
  # Issues have a description, details, source and severity:
  # * Description: describes the issue, typically with a single sentence.
  # * Details: provides more details about the problem. It is useful to report the output of a
  #   command failure.
  # * Source: indicates the source of the problem. In Agama, the issues usually comes from some
  #   unexpected situation in the system (e.g., missing device, etc) or from a wrong config (e.g.,
  #   missing user, etc).
  # * Severity: sets the severity of the issue. For now, issues could have warn or error severity.
  #   Error severity indicates that the installation cannot start.
