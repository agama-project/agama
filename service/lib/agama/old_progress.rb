module Agama
  # Class to manage progress
  #
  # It allows to configure callbacks to be called on each step and also when the progress finishes.
  #
  # In most cases all steps are known in advance (e.g., "probing software", "probing storage", etc.)
  # but, in some situations, only the number of steps is known (e.g., "Installing package X").
  #
  # Use the Progress.with_descriptions to initialize a progress with known step descriptions and
  # Progress.with_size when only the number of steps is known
  #
  # @example
  #
  #   progress = Progress.with_size(3)              # 3 steps
  #   progress.on_change { puts progress.message }  # configures callbacks
  #   progress.on_finish { puts "finished"  }       # configures callbacks
  #
  #   progress.step("Doing step1") { step1 }        # calls on_change callbacks and executes step1
  #   progress.step("Doing step2") { step2 }        # calls on_change callbacks and executes step2
  #
  #   progress.current_step                         #=> <Step>
  #   progress.current_step.id                      #=> 2
  #   progress.current_step.description             #=> "Doing step2"
  #
  #   progress.finished?                            #=> false

  #   progress.step("Doing step3") do               # calls on_change callbacks, executes the given
  #     progress.current_step.description           # block and calls on_finish callbacks
  #   end                                           #=> "Doing step3"
  #
  #   progress.finished?                            #=> true
  #   progress.current_step                         #=> nil
  #
  # @example Progress with known step descriptions
  #
  #   progress = Progress.with_descriptions(["Partitioning", "Installing", "Finishing"])
  #   progress.step { partitioning }                      # next step
  #   progress.current_step.description                   #=> "Partitioning"
  #   progress.step("Installing packages") { installing } # overwrite the description
  #   progress.current_step.description                   # "Installing packages"
