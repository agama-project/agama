      # Volume conversion to JSON hash according to schema.
      #
      # This class was in the past meant to convert the 'volumes' section of the ProposalSettings,
      # when we used to have a Guided strategy. So each conversion represented a volume that was
      # meant to be part of the proposal (as a new partition, LV, etc.). That Guided strategy does
      # not exist anymore.
      #
      # Now the volumes are only used to describe the templates used by the product to represent
      # the suggested/acceptable settings for each mount point, since the class Volume is still
      # (ab)used for that purpose. Thus, this conversion now serves that purpose.
