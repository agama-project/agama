# Goal of this file is monkey patch Popup and Report functionality to not try to use UI
# and instead adapt it for agama needs.
# Do not directly require agama ruby files to be able to keep autoyast converter and agama
# independent.
# TODO: what to do if it runs without agama? Just print question to stderr?
