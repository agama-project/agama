module Y2Storage
  # Class to calculate a storage proposal for auto-installation using Agama.
  #
  # @note The storage config (initial_settings param in constructor) is modified in several ways:
  #   * The search configs are resolved.
  #   * Every config with an unfound search (e.g., a drive config, a partition config) is removed if
  #     its search has #if_not_found set to skip.
  #
  #   It would be preferable to work over a copy instead of modifying the given config. In some
  #   cases, the config object is needed to generate its JSON format. The JSON result would not
  #   be 100% accurate if some elements are removed.
  #
  #   The original config without removing elements is needed if:
  #     * The current proposal is the initial proposal automatically calculated by Agama. In
  #       this case, the config is generated from the product definition. The config JSON format is
  #       obtained by converting the config object to JSON.
  #     * The current proposal was calculated from a settings following the guided schema. This
  #       usually happens when a proposal is calculated from the UI. In this case, a config is
  #       generated from the guided settings. The config JSON format is obtained by converting the
  #       config object to JSON.
  #
  #   In those two cases (initial proposal and proposal from guided settings) no elements are
  #   removed from the config because it has no searches with skip:
  #     * The config from the product definition has a drive that fails with unfound search (i.e.,
  #       there is no candidate device for installing the system).
  #     * The config from the guided settings has all drives and partitions with search set to
  #       error. The proposal fails if the selected devices are not found.
  #
  #   In the future there could be any other scenario in which it would be needed to keep all the
  #   elements from an initial config containing searches with skip.
  #
  # @example Creating a proposal from the current Agama configuration
  #   config = Agama::Storage::Config.new_from_json(config_json)
  #   proposal = Y2Storage::AgamaProposal.new(config)
  #   proposal.proposed?            # => false
  #   proposal.devices              # => nil
  #   proposal.planned_devices      # => nil
  #
  #   proposal.propose              # Performs the calculation
  #
  #   proposal.proposed?            # => true
  #   proposal.devices              # => Proposed layout
